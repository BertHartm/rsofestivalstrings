        <h1>Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra Festival Strings</h1>
        <h2>An Educational Outreach Program</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p><strong>Festival Strings</strong> is an educational outreach program sponsored by the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra, and includes young musicians from over 30 towns in northern New Jersey. The group comes together for five intense rehearsals and a wonderful concert in Ridgewood each winter.</p>
        <p>Membership in the orchestra is open to all string players in grades six through eight upon the recommendation of their school or private study music teachers; all students are accepted without audition. Although most students who participate are members of their school orchestra, the activity also serves many students from communities without school string programs. Abilities on their instruments must include a command of first position, with extensions and accidentals, and facility in the higher positions for more advanced sections of the orchestra. High school alumni of the program often return to serve as rehearsal assistants to help with tuning and placement adjudication.</p>
        <p>The group was originally organized by Dr. Sandra Dackow under the auspices of the New Jersey units of the National School Orchestra Association and the American String Teachers Association. Todd Van Beveren has conducted the Festival Strings Orchestra since 2009.</p>
